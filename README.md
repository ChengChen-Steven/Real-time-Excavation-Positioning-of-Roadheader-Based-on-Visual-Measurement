# Real-time-Excavation-Positioning-of-Roadheader-Based-on-Visual-Measurement
Visual measurement is a construction positioning method developed in recent years. Combining visual measurements with on-site Guiyang subway construction, this paper proposes an automatic positioning method of roadheader excavation, replacing human vision by machine vision, and changing the current situation in tunnel excavation. First, a laser beam emits from a distance to the tunnel face. Pictures taken by a camera set on the body of roadheader are analyzed digitally based on RGB system by building a computer model by using MATLAB. The model extracts spots’ centers. Then, based on mathematical analysis of digital image, model gives the decoupled eigenvalues of positional relationship between the actual position and the standard position of roadheader in three principal directions, so as to effectively guide the construction and implement automation. This paper also makes experiments to compare characteristics of single laser spot by RGB decomposition, test model’s accuracy in extracting image of laser beam, and use a similar model to analyze the impact of camera distortion in the actual work.
